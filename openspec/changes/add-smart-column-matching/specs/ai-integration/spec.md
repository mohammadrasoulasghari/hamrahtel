# AI Integration Specification - Smart Column Matching

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Optimized Prompt Generation with Preprocessed Data

The system SHALL generate AI prompts from PHP analysis, not raw file data.

#### Scenario: Prompt includes PHP findings

-   **WHEN** AI is called for semantic analysis
-   **THEN** prompt includes:
    -   Structured PHP findings (schema differences, data issues)
    -   Sample of matched row pairs (not all rows)
    -   Summary of unmatched rows
    -   User context/description
-   **AND** does NOT include: Raw full file contents, schema details (AI doesn't need to analyze schema)

#### Scenario: Token-efficient prompt

-   **WHEN** constructing AI request
-   **THEN** prompt is optimized:
    -   Max 50 matched pairs (not 5000 rows)
    -   Unmatched rows as summary (not full data)
    -   Structured findings (JSON) instead of prose
-   **AND** reduces token usage by 70-80%
-   **AND** reduces API costs significantly

### Requirement: Focused AI Analysis Request

The system SHALL request specific semantic analysis, not schema exploration.

#### Scenario: AI validates data quality

-   **WHEN** AI analyzes findings
-   **THEN** AI is asked to:
    -   Assess data quality issues found by PHP
    -   Validate if differences are expected or anomalies
    -   Score severity of each discrepancy
    -   Suggest fixes or explanations
-   **AND** AI is NOT asked to: list columns, count rows (PHP already did this)

#### Scenario: AI generates business insights

-   **WHEN** comparing preprocessed data
-   **THEN** AI generates:
    -   Root cause analysis for differences
    -   Data quality recommendations
    -   Potential data integrity issues
    -   Patterns or correlations found
-   **AND** response focuses on actionable insights, not raw diffs

### Requirement: Time Estimation for Processing

The system SHALL estimate total processing time before starting comparison.

#### Scenario: User sees time estimate

-   **WHEN** user reviews comparison preview
-   **THEN** system shows:
    -   Estimated total time (e.g., "تقریباً 25 ثانیه")
    -   Breakdown: schema detection (~2s), joining (~3s), analysis (~5s), AI (~15s)
    -   Message in Persian: "پردازش شامل [X] مرحله است"
-   **AND** estimate is based on: file size, row count, selected model

#### Scenario: Estimate accuracy

-   **WHEN** estimating time
-   **THEN** calculation considers:
    -   File sizes (discovery time)
    -   Row count (joining & analysis time)
    -   Selected AI model (GPT-4 slower than faster models)
    -   Complexity of join operation
-   **AND** estimate is within ±20% of actual time

### Requirement: Processing Progress Feedback

The system SHALL keep user informed during long-running comparisons.

#### Scenario: Progress display during processing

-   **WHEN** comparison is running
-   **THEN** UI shows progress bar with:
    -   Current step: "Schema Detection" → "Joining Rows" → "Analysis" → "AI Processing" → "Complete"
    -   Percentage complete (0-100%)
    -   Elapsed time
    -   Estimated remaining time
    -   Visual spinner or animation

#### Scenario: Step-by-step progress

-   **WHEN** user watches processing
-   **THEN** each completed phase shows:
    -   ✅ Schema detection complete (2s)
    -   🔄 Joining rows... (3s of 3s)
    -   ⏳ Analysis (in progress)
-   **AND** user knows system is working, not hung

### Requirement: AI Response Handling for Large Datasets

The system SHALL handle AI processing gracefully even with optimized data.

#### Scenario: AI timeout with partial results

-   **WHEN** AI processing times out or fails
-   **THEN** system displays:
    -   PHP findings (always available)
    -   Message: "تحلیل AI به دلایلی موفق نشد، اما یافته‌های ساختاری در دسترس است"
    -   Partial AI results if any
    -   User can retry AI analysis

#### Scenario: AI response too large

-   **WHEN** AI response exceeds size limits
-   **THEN** system:
    -   Truncates response gracefully
    -   Preserves key findings
    -   Adds note: "تحلیل خلاصه‌شده است"
    -   Offers downloadable full analysis

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: OpenRouter API Communication

**Original**: Send full file data to AI for comparison.
**Modified**: Send only preprocessed findings + sample data to AI for semantic analysis.

#### Scenario: Efficient API communication

-   **WHEN** calling OpenRouter API
-   **THEN** request includes:
    -   PHP analysis object (structured data)
    -   Filtered row samples (max 50)
    -   File metadata (not full files)
-   **AND** reduces request size by 80%
-   **AND** reduces token usage & cost

#### Scenario: Reduced timeout risk

-   **WHEN** API call is made with smaller payload
-   **THEN** response is faster
-   **AND** timeout risk is reduced
-   **AND** overall system reliability improves

### Requirement: Comparison Prompt Generation

**Original**: Build prompt from raw files with samples.
**Modified**: Build prompt from PHP analysis results with filtered samples.

#### Scenario: Structured prompt format

-   **WHEN** building AI prompt
-   **THEN** structure is:
    ```
    1. PHP Findings (schema, differences, issues)
    2. Sample Data (matched pairs, key values)
    3. Unmatched Summary (counts, patterns)
    4. User Context (description)
    5. Analysis Request (what AI should focus on)
    ```
-   **AND** avoids repetition (PHP already analyzed schema)

#### Scenario: AI Model Selection

-   **WHEN** building prompt
-   **THEN** model is selected based on:
    -   Complexity of comparison (simple vs complex)
    -   File size (smaller → faster model OK)
    -   User tier/budget (if applicable)
-   **AND** adjusts expected quality accordingly

### Requirement: HTML Report Generation

**Original**: AI generates HTML report from raw data.
**Modified**: AI generates HTML report focusing on semantic insights, complementing PHP findings.

#### Scenario: Report structure

-   **WHEN** generating report
-   **THEN** report includes:
    -   PHP Section: Schema differences, matched/unmatched summary
    -   AI Section: Quality assessment, insights, recommendations
    -   Combined View: Side-by-side findings
-   **AND** each section clearly labeled in Persian

#### Scenario: Report styling

-   **WHEN** rendering report
-   **THEN** uses:
    -   Color coding: Green (matches), Red (differences), Yellow (warnings)
    -   RTL layout (Persian)
    -   Clear section headers
    -   Tailwind CSS for responsive design
    -   Tables for structured data
    -   Charts for summary stats (optional Phase 2)

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Raw Full-File Data in AI Prompts

**Reason**: Wasteful token usage, poor scaling, redundant analysis (schema handled by PHP).
**Migration**: Send only preprocessed PHP findings + key samples to AI. AI focuses on semantic analysis, not schema exploration.

### Requirement: High Token Count Per Comparison

**Reason**: Expensive, scales poorly, inefficient for large files.
**Migration**: Optimized prompts reduce tokens by 70-80%. Better cost efficiency, faster responses.
